## 👋 Hi, I’m @Snoupix

I'm a junior Full-Stack web developer passionate about programming since 2018.

- 🛩️ I’m currently learning deep CS by using my favorite system language (Rust), while doing some web application projects.
- 🏎️ I love learning new languages to see how each differ from others and for each language, I'm getting closer to Assembly, which is really interesting !
- 🎮 I am using React, Remix, Tailwind and, of course, Typescript for my main projets.
- 🔫 Here is my [contact page](https://snoupix.dev/contact) to reach me.
- ⚡ Fun fact, each emoji above is one of my passions apart from programming !
