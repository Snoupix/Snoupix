## 👋 Hi, I’m @Snoupix

I'm a Full-Stack web developer passionate about programming since 2020.

- 🛩️ I’m currently learning deep CS by using my favorite system language (Rust), while doing some web application projects, CLIs, APIs... aside.
- 🏎️ I love learning new languages/frameworks to see how each differ from others with their own philosophies and designs, I think this is really interesting.
- 🎮 I am using Svelte(kit) or React with Remix, Tailwindcss and, of course, Typescript for my main web projets. (Even though, I'm trying webassembly (WASM), HTMX and HTML templating with Go and Rust!)
- 🎸 Here is my [contact page](https://snoupix.dev/contact) to reach me.
- 🌮 Also, I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), btw.
- ⚡ Fun fact, each emoji above is one of my passions apart from programming !
